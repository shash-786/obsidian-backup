Multilevel inheritance in Python is when a class inherits from another class, and then a third class inherits from the second, forming a chain. Each level specializes the class further, adding its own attributes and methods while retaining those from its ancestors.

In my example:

- **`Animal`** is the base class with general `name` and `species` attributes and a `show` method.
- **`Dog`** inherits from `Animal`. It adds a `breed` and overrides `show` to also print the breed, calling `super().show()` to reuse `Animal`'s display logic. Its `__init__` calls `super().__init__(name, 'Dog')` to initialize the `Animal` part.
- **`Poodle`** inherits from `Dog`. It adds `color`, and similarly overrides `show` and `__init__`, calling `super()` to leverage `Dog`'s (and by extension, `Animal`'s) functionality.

When `p = Poodle('Gonku', 'Brown')` is created and `p.show()` is called, the methods are executed in reverse order of inheritance (Poodle's `show`, then Dog's `show` via `super()`,then Animal's `show` via `super()`), ensuring all relevant attributes are displayed. This creates a clear "is-a" relationship: a Poodle is a Dog, and a Dog is an Animal.

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name, species):
        self.name = name
        self.species = species
    def show(self):
        print(f'Name: {self.name}')
        print(f'Species: {self.species}')

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        super().__init__(name, 'Dog')
        self.breed = breed
    def show(self):
        super().show()
        print(f'Breed: {self.breed}')

class Poodle(Dog):
    def __init__(self, name, color):
        super().__init__(name, 'Poodle')
        self.color = color
    def show(self):
        super().show()
        print(f'Color: {self.color}')

print(Poodle.__mro__)
p = Poodle('Gonku', 'Brown')
p.show()

'''
(<class '__main__.Poodle'>, <class '__main__.Dog'>, <class '__main__.Animal'>, <class 'object'>)
Name: Gonku
Species: Dog
Breed: Poodle
Color: Brown
'''
```
