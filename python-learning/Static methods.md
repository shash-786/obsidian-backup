Static methods in Python are methods bound to a class rather than an object of the class. They do not require an instance of the class to be called and cannot access or modify the class's state. Static methods are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator.
```python
class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    def my_static_method(arg1, arg2):
        # Method implementation
        return arg1 + arg2

# Calling the static method
result = MyClass.my_static_method(5, 3)
print(result) # Output: 8

# Can also be called through an instance, though it is not recommended
obj = MyClass()
result = obj.my_static_method(5, 3)
print(result) # Output: 8
```
