- Containers package code and dependencies in an isolated environment, virtualizing the OS for portability across different environments.
- Compared to VMs, containers are lightweight, start quickly, and enable rapid scaling of applications on a single host.
- Containers facilitate building modular microservices that can be deployed and scaled independently across multiple hosts based on demand and failures.
