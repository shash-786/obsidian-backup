**What is virtual private cloud?**
A virtual private cloud, or VPC, is a secure, individual, private cloud-computing model hosted within a public cloud – like Google Cloud. On a VPC, customers can run code, store data, host websites, and do anything else they could do in an ordinary private cloud, but this private cloud is hosted remotely by a public cloud provider. This means that VPC's combine the **scalability** and convenience of public cloud computing with the **data isolation** of private cloud computing.

**VPC Routing**
Google Cloud routes **define the paths that network traffic takes from a virtual machine (VM) instance to other destinations**. These destinations can be inside your Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network (for example, in another VM) or outside it.
