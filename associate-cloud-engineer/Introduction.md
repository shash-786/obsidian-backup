**Cloud Computing** - way of using IT has 5 traits

> customers get computing resources that are on-demand and self-service.

> customers get access to those resources over the internet, from anywhere they have a connection.

> the cloud provider has a big pool of those resources and allocates them to users out of that pool.

> the resources are elastic–which means they’re flexible, so customers can be.

> customers pay only for what they use, or reserve as they go.

*What is Serverless Compute?*
Serverless computing is a cloud computing model where developers build and run applications without managing servers. Google Cloud Run which allows customers to deploy their containerized micro services based application in a fully-managed environment is an example of serverless compute offering by Google.

  
*What are Caching Nodes?*
These are locations where high demand content is cached for quicker access, allowing applications to respond to user requests from the location that will provide the quickest response time.
