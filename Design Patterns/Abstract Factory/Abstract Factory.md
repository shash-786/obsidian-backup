Basically a encapsulation for creation of a set of objects. Enforces Consistency among products as the application gets instances of classes from only one set at a time. Promotes Loose coupling.

Might be complex to add new products. and adding new New Configuration (SQL DB in our case) will lead to class explosion (Many classes to add).

Use *Abstract Factory* when you want to enforce the use of only one family at a time.
