**Object pool** design pattern. This is also a factory pattern and is implemented through a factory method. But the biggest difference between the factory method and the object pool is that factory method always creates a new instance. But the object pool may return a cached instance. Object pool is not an official design pattern. However, it is still very useful in different kinds of applications, especially games. 

If your application is constructing and destroying lots of objects repetitively and this causes performance problems in the application. The problems may be due to the fact that creating the instance of the clauses from the scratch is expensive or repetitive construction and destruction is causing the heap to fragment. So to avoid these issues, an application can store the instances of the clause inside a pool. When it needs an instance, it will request the object from the pool and use it once it is done with that instance, it will be returned to the pool and can be reused later.
