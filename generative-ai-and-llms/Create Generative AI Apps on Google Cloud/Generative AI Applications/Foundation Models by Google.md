Vertex AI is a machine learning platform that lets you train and deploy machine learning models and AI applications, and customize LLMs for use in your AI-powered applications. Vertex AI provides APIs that allow you to use foundation models in your applications.

1) ==Gemini==: A powerful multimodal AI that understands and processes information from text, images, audio, PDFs, code, and video simultaneously for tasks like summarization, Q&A across modalities, and content understanding.
2) ==Imagen==: An AI model for creating and editing high-quality images from text prompts, upscaling images, and understanding visual content through captioning and visual Q&A.
3) ==Chirp==: A universal speech model that converts text into natural-sounding synthetic speech (text-to-speech) and accurately transcribes audio into text (speech-to-text).
4) ==Translation (Cloud Translation)==: Rapidly translates text between languages, allowing customization for style, tone, and industry-specific terminology by learning from provided examples.
5) ==Codey==: A suite of AI models designed for software development, enabling code generation from descriptions, offering a chatbot for coding assistance and debugging, and providing intelligent code completion.
6) ==Embeddings API==: Creates numerical representations (embeddings) of various data types like text, images, and videos, enabling tasks such as semantic search, classification, clustering, and recommendation systems.
7) ==MedLM==: A family of foundation models specifically fine-tuned for the healthcare industry, designed to assist with tasks like answering medical questions and drafting summaries from medical information.
