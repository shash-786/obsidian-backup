What is an agent?
An agent can be defined as a self contained execution unit which acts autonomously to achieve specific goals. 

The foundation for all agents in ADK is the `BaseAgent` class. It serves as the fundamental blueprint. To create functional agents, you typically extend `BaseAgent` in one of three main ways, catering to different needs – from intelligent reasoning to structured process control.
